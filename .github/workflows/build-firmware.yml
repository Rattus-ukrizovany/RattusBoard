          ## RattusBoard Firmware Release

          Automatically generated firmware build from commit [${{ github.sha }}](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/commit/${{ github.sha }}).

          ### Installation Instructions
          1. Download the `.uf2` file(s) from the assets below.
          2. Hold BOOTSEL and plug in USB on each Pico to enter bootloader mode.
          3. Drag the `.uf2` onto the RPI-RP2 drive for both halves.
          4. Connect halves with TRRS cable and plug USB into the left half.

          ### Features
          - Split keyboard support with auto hand detection
          - PMW3360 trackball integration (right half)
          - Rotary encoder support (right half)
          - VIA/Vial configuration support
          - Full QMK feature set

          For detailed setup instructions, see the [README](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}#-firmware-flashing--split-setup-important-clarification).
